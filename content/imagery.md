# Imagery Insights

## How do customers view imagery

- They want to see "Themselves" and not "Us"
- Stock photography does not play well with customers
- Actual pictures of customers or people that look like them are well received
- Images that serve no purpose are ignored
- Images need to have a purpose
- The ones that work fall into two groups
	- Images that reassure the customer that this content is indeed for them or people like them
	- Images that reassure the customer about the subject of content. 
	  Aircraft Engines on Aerospace Industry pages etc..
- Images "**do not work on Digital**" if they are "**Slow Burn**"
  Images need to make sense instantly just as much as text content does.

## How should images be used on pages

- Huge "HERO" banner images often obscure the actual purpose of the page and should be minimised where possible
- Images need to be scannable in the same way as content. 
  This means that images should align vertically and allow Visual oriented readers to scan them whilst also allowing Text oriented readers to ignore them. 
- Do not alternate them from left to right. This looks cute but makes it harder to read the page. 
- Images should have a clearly defined purpose
- They should have Captions and Alternate text to support Accesibility

## Scent Trails
- Scent rails are what people follow when they are looking for something and browsing through the site
- They get the "Scent"of what they seek from content, navigation menus, images and other subtle "on page" factors
- Images can be very powerful in creating that "Scent" on a page. 
- Images can be very powerful at maintaining the "Scent Trail" as users browse through the site
- Images can also totally destroy "Scent Trails" by not being appropriate. 
- People make snap decisions based on Imagery even quicker than they do from Content. This can be very good or very bad.
For these reasons it is critical to understand the Scent Trail you are trying to foster when using imagery anywhere.  

## Trip Hazards
- Gender Bias is picked up in images
- Racial Bias is picked up in images
	- This ignores any actual Gender or Race bias in the represented group. 
- When using images you have to be honest with yourself about what the images represent. 
	- Are they representative of the **Current** situation or demographic
	- Are they representative of the **Desired** situation or demographic
- When representing renewables...try not to look like a Power Company advert. It comes up again and again.
- Colours and Typography often go wrong. Think carefully about placing Text over an Image and ensure that it is accessible and legible. If in doubt....then don't. 
- Lots of Words on an image, rather defeats the purpose of having an image. 
- Keep each image simple (avoid noise)
- Starting with a **Negative statement is counter-productive**.
- Don't make people Think to hard. Images are a quick way of communicating and being too clever almost always backfires
- Images that contradict the Scent Trail are counter productive
