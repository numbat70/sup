## Top 10 things we hear from Businesses


???note "1. Get to the point"

	- Business owners are time-poor. <br>
	- They don’t want to waste time reading through a lot of content. We need to get to the point quickly or we’ll lose them. <br>
	- They like clear, simple language and bullet points. <br>
	- **They hate long paragraphs and jargon.** <br>
	- When it comes to our digital services, we tend to focus a lot of how things work technically and what they look like<br>
		- These are both important, but so much of the feedback we get from customers is about the words that we use. <br>
		- Words matter. 
		- We need to choose them carefully. <br>
	
	Customer quotes <br>
	
	- “There are a lot of words there and my time is really precious.”  <br>
	- “I don’t have the time to read the whole page.”  <br>
	- “I’m dyslexic – that wall of words is off putting. I’d prefer to see it broken down a wee bit.” <br>

??? note "2. Keep it simple "
	- Customers tell us they like it when we keep things simple. <br>
	- We should avoid anything that gets in the way of them doing what they came to our website/service to do. <br>
	- When our websites and digital services look and act like other government sites that they’re familiar with, they perceive us as trustworthy. <br>

	Customer quotes: <br>

	- “It’s like HMRC, so it seems intuitive from that point of view.”  <br>
	- “I like the clean layout.”  <br>
	- “It looks nice and simple. I would make sure to keep it that way. No need to complicate it.”  <br>

??? note "3. Only ask me for information once "

	- Customers expect us to remember information that they have given us and not ask for it again. <br>
	- When we ask them for information that they think we should already have, they get irritated and lose trust in us. <br>
	
	Customer quotes: <br>
	
	- “You keep asking me for the same data. It is annoying and also erodes my trust in you.” <br>
	- “I’m copying and pasting content from one application to the next.” <br>
	- “I filled out the same application for three things.” <br>

??? note "4. Tell me if I’m eligible "

	- Customers want to be able to easily see if they’re eligible for funding or support straight away. <br>
	- We need to be clear about what our eligibility criteria are, and what information and documents they will need to gather to apply.  <br>
	
	Customer quotes: <br>
	
	- “'Is my business eligible’ should be first up – why waste my time?” 
	- “If you aren’t clear what you are being asked before you begin, it’s quite difficult to get your thoughts together.” <br>
	- “We got all the way through and then were told we weren’t suitable.” <br>

??? note "5. Don’t take too long to make a decision "

	- Our customers are busy people with businesses to run. <br>
	- They don’t want to have to wait for ages for us to decide whether we can help them or not. <br>
	- They need to know who is dealing with their application and how long it will take to hear back from us. 
	
	Customer quotes: <br>
	
	- “Speed is of the essence in business.” <br>
	- “I can’t wait three months to fill in a form.” <br>
	- “The application process is slow, complicated and created added pressure on us. Not being able to start the project before the application has been approved.” <br>

??? note "6. I want to talk to someone "

	- We can build great digital services, but there will always be people who just want to speak to someone. <br>
	- That’s understandable, given the complex issues that businesses can face. <br>
	- We need to make sure that we always give people the option to talk to a human being if they want to.  <br><br>
	
	- People who have worked with us tell us how much they value the relationships that they have with SE staff, and how the conversations they have with us are helpful to their business. <br>
	- Having someone who they trust and can go to with questions is important.  <br><br>
	
	- Businesses are increasingly telling us that they want to communicate with us via live chat, because they see it as a quick way to get an answer. <br>
	- As one business owner explained, live chat would allow him to talk to us while doing his work at the same time. Time-poor, remember?  <br>
	
	Customer quotes: 
	
	- “Speaking to someone is still valid these days.” <br>
	- “I would probably just pick up the phone.” <br>
	- “It’s important to have a human on the end of the telephone.” <br>

??? note "7. Give me a copy "

	- When businesses apply for something with us, they want to be able to access a copy of what they have sent, whether that’s through a link, a downloadable PDF/Word document, or an email. <br>
	- If our systems do this for them, they feel reassured.   <br>
	
	Customer quotes: <br>
	
	- “I would be annoyed if I hadn’t downloaded the summary before I submitted it.” <br>
	- “I would have thought a copy of my application would be sent to my email.” <br>
	- “I like that you can download and review your application.” <br>

??? note "8. Give me a template "

	- When we ask customers to share documents like project plans or business plans with us, some people would feel more comfortable if we provided a template so they could see the format that we were looking for. <br>
	- This helps them feel reassured that they’re giving us the information that we need in the right way. <br>
	
	Customer quotes: <br>
	
	- “It would be nice to see an example of a project plan or a template.” <br>
	- “A template that you could populate would help.” <br>
	- “A project plan template would be a big help to small businesses.” <br>


??? note "9. I want money "

	- SE can offer businesses support with everything from market research and innovation to intellectual property and sustainability, but what do businesses want from us? Money. <br>
	- We know that when we do give them non-financial support they find it valuable – sometimes more valuable than a grant – but they’re not necessarily looking for it. Our analytics and user research show that funding is their top priority. <br>
	
	Customer quotes: <br>
	
	- “You give great advice, but let’s see some cash.” <br>
	- “I’m looking for words like ‘money, finance’ – I just really want some money.” <br>
	- “People just want to know how much money you can get.” <br>


??? note "10. I need to be part of the gang "

	- Some businesses think that we only offer support to big companies, and that you have to be ‘part of the club’ in order to work with us.  <br>
	
	Customer quotes: <br>
	
	- “People still need to speak Scottish Enterprise.” <br>
	- “If you were not used to SE form filling then it might be tricky. We know the right buzzwords.” <br>
	- “Trying to get in was difficult.” <br>


### Common themes 

??? note "Don’t waste my time "
	People who run businesses are busy, and they may be doing multiple roles in their company. <br>
	**They don’t want to waste time reading a lot of content, giving us information that we already have, trying to figure out whether they are eligible for something or not, or waiting for us to make decisions.**  <br>

??? note "Don’t make me think "
	Our customers shouldn’t have to try to figure out what we’re offering or what we’re asking them to do. <br>
	**We should make it easy for them.** <br>

??? note "Don’t stress me out "
	Applying for funding or support can be stressful, and the last thing we want to do is make it worse. <br>
	**When don’t make things clear enough for our customers, we could be adding to their anxiety.** And that’s not what we want.  <br>

??? note "Past Experience"
    **Customers**<br>
	- Variable (More positive than Non-Customers)<br>
    - Mostly for small companies<br>
    - They take you so far, and then dry up<br>
    - Tailored response :-)<br>
    - Good to talk to actual people<br><br>

    - Not awesome<br>
    - Bureaucratic<br> 
	- Complicated<br>
    - Poorly Executed<br>
    - Too bossy & time consuming (ROI)<br> 
	**Insights**<br>
    - Mixed, largely negative,  response from initial engagement.<br>
    - Those non-customers that had an interaction with SE felt disappointed  because of low levels of service.<br>
    - Either it was deemed unhelpful or not relevant for their business, or it felt clinical, complicated and badly executed.<br>
    - A lot of this is driven by having funding requests denied.<br>
    - Or simply not meeting SE criteria and reacting to this badly.<br>
    - (Entitlement culture and,  frankly, laziness)<br>

??? note "Relationship with SE"
    **Customers** <br>
	- Very good (mostly)<br>
    - They do a lot of things for/with us<br>
    - They can be a bit time consuming<br> 
	- Some of their initiatives are good whilst some ar e bad<br>
    - Bureaucratic<br>
    - Good Relationships with AMs/Specialists<br> 
	- Comms and Knowledge<br>
    - Invested in Sustainability & Net Zero<br>
    - Helpful<br> <br>
	**Non-Customers**<br>
	- Personal relationships are good<br>
    - Possibly not that great for Start-Ups<br>
    - Partners<br> 
	- Evolving<br>
	**Insights**<br>
    - Customer experience is very positive overall.<br>
    - The role of the AM is centrally and crucially  important in the relationship.<br>
    - However, some, who have been with SE for a long-time, complain about the inconsistency of AMs.<br>
    - Partners are broadly supportive and positive.<br>

??? note "What people think our Values are"
    **Customers**<br>
	- Open & Transparent<br>
    - Agile (No description of what that means)<br>
    - Collaborative<br>
    - Invested in Equality, Inclusion, Sustainability and Diversity<br> 
	- Your people go above and beyond<br>
    - Driving employment<br>
    - Selling Scotland<br><br>
    **Partners** <br>
	- Growth<br>
    - Inclusion & Equality<br>
    - Improving Scotland<br> 
	- Supportive <br>
    - Sustainable Development<br>
    **Insights**<br>
    - No specific focus or sense of what your core values are<br>
    - For many it was a difficult question to answer and resorted to guesswork.<br>
    - Again, lack of speed coming through here from some partners.<br>

??? note "How people feel about the Our Brand Purpose"
	**Insights**<br>
    - It's too long.<br> 
    - And it's a little jargony, but that's understandable to people<br> 
    - And it recognizes that it needs to speak to businesses about how their support can drive the economy. <br>
    - And it recognizes that it needs to sneak to businesses about how their support can drive the economy<br> 
    - However some misunderstanding that SF are innovators rather than driving innovation as stated)<br> 
    - Nevertheless, it's broadly in line with perceptions and seems appropriate<br>

??? note "Does our Purpose resonate with you"
    **Insight** <br>
    - Alienating to smaller businesses<br>
    - It reflects but does not really connect with customers<br>
    - Lacks Emotion & Energy<br> 


??? note "Language"
    **Insight** <br>
    - There's a juxtaposition between the high-level language that's used in your purpose and the personal and accessible service that's offered by SE.<br>
    - Too jargony comes through strongly - even for Partners<br>
    - And to some extent also too corporate - for larger businesses<br>
    - It's not as clear as it could be about Calls to Action and business benefits<br>
    - Not from this but from the workshops there's just too much focus on SE rather than the customer. <br>
    - What's in it for me.<br>


??? note "Language by other B2B"
    **Customers** <br>
    - Banks<br> 
	- Consultancies (Deloittes, KPMG...)<br>
    - Revolut<br>
    - Slack<br>
    **Non-Customers** <br>
	- FSB Newsletters<br>
    - Chambers stuff :-)<br>
    - xxx<br>
    - xxx<br> 
    **Partners** <br>
	- Codebase<br>
    - Techscaler<br>
    - AWS<br> 
    - Google for Start Ups<br> 
    **Insight** <br>
    - Non-customers relate more to networks and support organisations<br>
    - Customers have a more high-brow point of reference – eg Consultancies<br>
    
??? note "SE Business Ambitions- What do you think?"
    **Insight** <br>
    - Quite cynical<br>
    - Most customers say this is reflective of their experience, EXPECT internationalization. Given rising costs and Brexit complexities, this makes internationalization difficult for businesses at the moment.<br><br>
    - Are SE these things or do they enable these things?  Watch out you don’t overclaim.  Your people are good at encouraging these things but the businesses themselves actually do it.<br>

    
??? note "Do SE's ambitions resonate with you"
    **Insight** <br>
    - Depends on the business<br>
    - SE is not innovative. It is the facilitator of Innovation.<br>

??? note "Is SE driving innovation"
    **Insight** <br>
    - There’s a theme emerging that SE shouldn’t be claiming that they are innovators and that it’s the companies they support that innovate.  There’s a risk that you sound like you are taking the credit for innovation or that it could at least be interpreted that way.<br>
    -Talk more clearly about being facilitators and enabling<br>
    
??? note "Understanding the Ecosystem"
    **Insight** <br>
    - Good awareness among customers and general assumption that they are about international trading<br>
    - And SDI’s positioning is a lot clearer than SE’s.  Feels more focused and targeted.<br>
    - Generally positive attitudes to the SDI/SE relationship.<br>
    - But for those who do not work with SDI  it’s not clear where overlap stops.<br>
    
??? note "SDI"
    **Insight** <br>
    - Good awareness among customers and general assumption that they are about international trading<br>
    - And SDI’s positioning is a lot clearer than SE’s.  Feels more focused and targeted.<br>
    - Generally positive attitudes to the SDI/SE relationship.<br>
    - But for those who do not work with SDI  it’s not clear where overlap stops.<br>

??? note "Business Gateway"
    **Insight** <br>
    - This is area of most confusion.<br>
    - Many understand BG’s role as a portal into SE but many more confuse SE for BG in conversation, especially small or start up non-customers of SE.<br>
    - But people DO generally understand that BG is for start ups.  (It’s just that many think SE/BG are the same thing).<br>
    - Even during respondent recruitment there was confusion with Free Found SE customers ACTUALLY being BG customers.<br>
    - Seems to be a lot of misattribution to SE of services non-customers have experienced or more likely heard of that were actually provided by BG<br>
    - Several respondents see BG as a UK national (not Scottish) entity.<br>
    - BG advice and support seen as more off the shelf, not tailored like SE.<br>
    
??? note "SMAS"
    **Insight** <br>
    - Very low awareness but relatively easy to guess their role. Not much real association with SE.<br>
    - Only a handful of respondents had worked with them,<br>


??? note "CDS (co-operative development scotland)"
    **Insight** <br>
    - Virtually no awareness across all groups<br> 


??? note "Brand Scotland"
    **Insight** <br>
    - Low awareness<br>
    - If pushed, reasonably correct assumption that they promote Scotland.<br>
    - No link to SE really.<br>

??? note "Digital Chanels - Website CUSTOMERS "
    **Insight** <br>
    - Quite a few have never used it at all<br>
    - Reliance is on Account Manager, rather than digital channels – much more important and clouds opinion<br>
    - Generally, slightly more negative than non-clients<br>
    - Again, several comments that it is fairly unremarkable – but that could be seen as inoffensive<br>
    - No spontaneous praise<br>

??? note "Digital Chanels - Website NON-CUSTOMERS "
    **Insight** <br>
    - Very mixed point of view, but leaning towards negative<br>
    - No real issues with navigation<br>
    - Largely seen as clean, text based and factual<br>
    - Broadly seen as functional, and many find it easy to use – not especially engaging<br>
    - But for many it’s quite bland/unremarkable – a lot of comments about nothing standing out<br>
    - Several mentions of stock photography usage<br>
    - A bit wordy<br>
    - Over emphasis on net zero and green agenda<br>
    
??? note "Digital Chanels - Website PARTNERS "
    **Insight** <br>
    - Possibly the most negative overall<br>
    - Acknowledgment of need to meet a wide variety of audiences which is difficult<br>
    
??? note "Digital Chanels - Brand Identity"
    **Insight** <br>
    - Very widely recognized<br>
    - Some confusion with energy companies<br>
    - Perfectly fit for purpose, but a minority see it as quite dated<br>
    - It’s not exactly setting the heather on fire, but neither is it damaging the brand<br>

??? note "Digital Chanels - Youtube"
    **Insight** <br>
    - Mixed opinions and quite strongly held.<br>
    - But largely an acknowledgement that video is a good medium, especially for case studies (although these also have detractors)<br>
    - ‘How to’ videos are also welcome, but content is outdated<br>
    - Low awareness of SE channel specifically<br>
    - Not inappropriate<br>

    
??? note "Digital Chanels - LinkedIn"
    **Insight** <br>
    - The star performer – your natural home<br>
    - Very strongly endorsed<br>
    - Not many follow the SE page, and some follow their AM – but seen as positive to customers<br>
    - Great for communicating events and news/updates<br>
    - You are acknowledged as using the medium well.<br>

    
??? note "Digital Chanels - Facebook"
    **Insight** <br>
    - An ambivalent response<br>
    - Seen as becoming quite outdated<br>
    - Respondents struggled to understand WHY SE would use Facebook<br>

    

??? note "Digital Chanels - Twitter"
    **Insight** <br>
    - Its reputation has been tarnished for serious business users recently<br>
    - But it IS seen as a good business channel and an appropriate place for SE to communicate<br>
    - Jury is out long term<br>


??? note "Digital Chanels - Email"
    **Insight** <br>
    - This is your strongest engagement channel<br>
    - But more for AM to customer engagement than marketing<br>
    - It’s seen as a communications rather than marketing channel – other than newsletter<br>
    - Looking for more tailored content that’s relevant to their circumstances<br>
    - Of course, some note that email is generally overused in business so there are pros and cons here<br>

??? note "Digital Chanels - Other"
    **Insight** <br>
    - Significant mention of TikTok as up and coming as a channel - even for SE<br>
    - Instagram spontaneously mentioned as a useful channel for SE  but less enthusiastically<br>
    



## 2021: SE Initial Research

### Files

- [SE.com-InitialResearch-Aug2021](files/2021-SE-InitialResearch.pdf)

### Summary
**Purpose**
- We are interested in where you would look on our site [https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/](https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/)    for information.


??? note "Results: Pass / Fail"    
    **Success:**<br>
    - Only one user found the event Masterclass selling your business <br>
        - But <br>
    - 4 users did find the webpage about succession planning <br><br>
     **Fail:**<br>
    - One user made it to the learning zone but was unable to find the information <br>
    - One user made it to the funding and grants webpage and gave up<br>
    - One user made it to the contact us webpage after failing to find the information<br>
    - 4 users clicked on various bits on the homepage and gave up quickly <br>
    - 3 users used search and then gave up <br><br>
    **Conclusions:**
    - Events, podcasts and webinars are not obviously visible from the homepage <br>
    - Users are not explicitly searching for them <br>
    - Search doesn’t work as well as it should<br><br>

??? note "Missing Things:"
    - I was hoping to find a page labeled "management buy out" or "selling your company". I would expect key searches for those words to yield accurate results<br>
    - I was hoping to find an article or guide that was explicit in giving information on how to sell my company.<br>
    - I was hoping to find a direct page/link to get this info<br>
    - A menu option that more clearly labelled for selling companies?<br>
    - Something at top of page that would lead me to both topics, sell company, support buyout.<br>
    - I was looking for words i understand, like 'selling my business' or 'management buyout'. I didn't know the phrase succession planning but did work it out, and once I knew that was what I was looking for, I found it.<br>
    - I was hoping to find an article that would provide me with information on the topic, which it did. However, I did not find this for the term selling your company. I would expect to see how SE can support in that process.<br>
    - I was hoping to find any information at all on how I would sell my business or join a management buyout. However, there was nothing that I could find that covered this on the website.<br>

  
  

??? note "Suggested Changes:"
    - Seeing everything i saw on this website, everything is perfect to me.<br>
    - I would add a tag for the term 'selling your business'.... I am also aware that I did not use anything other than the search function. .. So let me try that now.... Found relatively easily using menu also. So can't complain.<br>
    - I would have probably put it underneath COVID19 as an option, as the current climate a lot of business they are selling their companies, so it would been a naturally search progression as a customer. Probably would have suggested it being under a different tab, instead of development as I felt it didn't fit with developing/growing a business.<br>
    - I would like to change the search results page. It is because it provides too many less relevant results after using the keywork - selling my company.<br>
    - I wouldn't associate selling of a business under business development, so I would maybe have a clearer or separate heading for that type of advice. I also don't automatically know the phrase 'succession planning' so maybe having another more widely understandable phrase as a heading would be better.<br>
    - Have the relevant information at top of page for both management buyout and selling a company. Even if they are unusual queries<br>
    - Making it easier to fiind.<br>
    - Improve the search feature to bring up pages with the title/description "management buy our" or "selling your company"<br>

- [SE.COM 2018 V3](files/2018-SE-TestFindings.pdf)


### Summary
**Purpose**<br>
- To improve our understanding of what people, with no recent contact,  think we do<br>
- To perform usability testing on a Scottish Enterprise website wireframe prototype,  to validate thinking around possible future state layout/design.<br>
- To inform the next design iteration<br>

??? note "Feedback on Wireframes"
    - People are interested in Scottish Enterprise BUT only in what we can do for them<br>
    - The “How we can help” Diagnostic is very popular both in language and concept. Most people would have followed this approach.<br>
    - The current ”**I Want To**” menu is mostly ignored and sometimes viewed as part of the Search Bar<br>
    - The “Search Bar” was used as the preferred bailout method, after failing to find relevant  Call’s To Action<br>
    - Large and impressive Stats are popular<br>
    - The ”**Fold**” is still a very real barrier to some people seeing our actual CTA’s.  <br>Do not over do the lead in content.<br>
    - The menu options were quite well received when people actually opened the menu (usually prompted during these tests)<br>

??? note "Details"
    - Guides Sections - needs to be higher up <br>
    - Eligibility for services made clear upfront, or signposting to other organisations who could help<br>
    - I want the homepage to be tailored to me <br>
    - Video – don’t want SE promotional video. Needs to be changed very regularly to show the website is keeping up to date, “videos of case studies more impact”.<br>
    - Sign in – business account with multiple logins preferred <br>
    - Language unclear and off putting, too much jargon <br>
    - The website needs to link to all other agencies offering businesses support and funding – what can we do? Who else can fill the gaps? A portal to all types of support<br>
    - Innovation important – could be upfront on site<br>
    - The categories for support look right <br>
    - Stats – impressive but not relevant to me<br>
    - Case studies – would prefer how to help companies achieve growth within the success stories. They need to be relevant to business age, stage of journey and industry <br>
    - Interactive – how can I feedback about the guides/drop downs if my industry isn’t listed? I want to add my knowledge.<br>

??? note "General"
    - Customers confused where to go for the right information<br>
    - Customers often unsure of which organisation they are dealing with<br>
    - Customers unclear why they get grant/support rejected<br>

??? note "Requesting Customer Details"
    - Don’t ask for too much information too early in the journey (eg high degree of surprise in asking for Companies House information)<br>
    - Belief that inputting details would result in “being marketed to”<br>

??? note "Communication"
    - Majority of users preferred telephone number to call if they got stuck<br>
    - Live Chat mixed reviews<br>
    - Businesses are interested in help from organisations (such as SE) BUT only if it is relevant to them<br>

??? note "Information"
    - Language needs to be clear<br>
    - The journey to get to relevant information should be simple and quick<br>
    - Large and impressive Stats are popular (but users questioned if they were real)<br>
    - Information ”Below the Fold” remains a very real barrier to some users seeing the actual CTA’s<br>

??? note "Content"
    - Users expect most things to be clickable<br>
    - Users expect interaction to be quick so indicated time it takes seen as irrelevant<br>
    - The “Search Bar” was used as the preferred bailout method, when the user struggled to find what they were looking for<br>
    - Menu Options were well received (though sometimes missed initially)<br>
    - Too much content not well received (eg Learning/Development section showcase because not relevant to them at this time)<br>
    - Case Studies are good but need to be directed to me and my sector <br>

## 2018: Women's Focus Group
### Files
- [Women Focus Group 2018: Women Entrepreneurs Focus Group.pptx](files/2018-WomenEntrepreneursFocus.pdf)


### Summary
**Purpose**
- to explore experience of online channels
- to discuss Business Support requirements
- to examine the Role of Networks in Business

??? note "Conclusions"
    - Up for transacting all activity on line <br>
    - Scalability really important ie as their business grows they want what they can do online to match<br>
    - Need the ability to upload multiple docs from electronic devices<br>
    - Too many business organisations offering advice – they are unsure who to go to for what<br>
    - Want business orgs to be joined up and/or refer to right place (but not having to go round the loop again)<br>
    - Experts giving business support must be knowledgeable about their industry (big problem)<br>
    - Companies expect conditions to be attached to funding support but needs to be fit for purpose<br>
    - Targets attached to funding can be too restrictive<br>
    - Networking important to them and they would be up for being approached to share advice<br>
    - Need to trust those within the networks<br>
    - Very clued up on our pre-pipeline and BG-SE pipeline process!<br>



??? note "Online Channels"
    - HMRC, Gov.uk, SAGEPay, Banks used <br>
    - Quickbooks “easy to use” (best website for uploading evidence, collating (mentioned in previous research) <br>
    - Nest Pensions Scheme and Workplace Pensions deemed not so good<br>
    - Transacting online for expenses, payrolls, buying, accounting, banking <br>
    - Appetite for everything mobile and online<br>
    - Wanted to electronically provide evidence <br>
    - Preference for cloud storage/dropbox <br>
    - Awareness of GDPR implications affecting elements of business such as payroll functions<br>
    - Scaleability most important<br>

??? note "Top Tasks"
    **Top Tasks Emerging:**<br>
    - Funding and grants for businesses<br>
    - Help to develop new products and services<br>
    - Advice and support for businesses looking to export products and services<br>
    - Improve business processes with our support<br>
    
    **New Cards Added:**<br>
    - Legislation<br>
    - Employability and apprenticeships<br>
    - Webchat<br>
    - Search<br>


??? note "Business Support"
    - Workforce development & employability information needed<br>
    - Council first port of call (local)<br>
    - Gov.UK – trusted and credible<br>
    - Gov.UK liked for - search bar/results, quick, fast, visibly updated<br>
    - Mixed response to amount of info to view – recommend overview with option for further information if needed<br>
    - Expectation that conditions will be attached to funding and services but conditions need to be tailored to the value of the support<br>
    - Value added to the business cannot be easily correlated to the support provided<br>
    - Effort and time to apply for funding and support often outweighs the value received<br>
    - Export Information expected from SDI site<br>
    - Expect accessible information for all and ability to apply online for support/services (for beta release)<br>
    -  Need for one Business Information Portal<br>
    - Mentoring important “it would be nice to have online access to business mentors”<br>
    - Everything in one place – more alignment with other organisations<br>
    - SE site should have links to all other organisations offering support (mentioned in previous research)<br>
    - Contacts - “It’s about getting to know who you need to know to get about” (ref SE)<br>
    - Accessing business support is challenging– asking a question doesn’t get you the information you need:<br>
    - Advisors coming out to support businesses don’t have the industry expertise and experience necessary<br>
    - Advisors should be upskilled to keep abreast of changing industry environments (mentioned previously).<br>

??? note "Quotes"
    - “2 meetings in 2 years – just make it happen”<br>
    - “crack demystifying the service”<br>
    - “man if you did all of this (business process) that would be great”<br>
    - “forms look for specific numbers on specific projects and I don’t always have all this information”<br>
    - FR defined in lots of different ways by advisors and the quality of information could actually inform how successful (or not) the company is – “I would be careful which  suppliers I would choose”<br>
    - progress bar on application useful<br>
    - a/c manager suggests suitable grants not on website<br>
    - companies want to grow but don’t know how<br>
    - downloads helpful<br>
    - Signposting extremely valuable<br>

## 2017: Account Manager Service Consumption
### Files
- [Account Manager Service Consumption: ](files/2017-AM-ServiceConsumption.pdf)


### Summary
- SE is driving towards establishing the minimum amount of support from us that a customer needs to go ahead with a project.
- AM’s can’t view their projects and the services supporting them in one place.  
- AM’s are a challenging group to cater for as they all work in different ways. It appears most behaviour is driven by systems that don’t work.
- All evidence supports the model of presenting customers with a high level project supported by services.
- Currently systems do not support this model and force a disjointed approach to be adopted (and work arounds to be created).

??? note "Background"
    - Acc Manager and account team are responsible for identifying the pieces of a project.
     - Currently these are then supported by our **54 products which are grouped into frameworks**:
    	- **Strategy Development**
    	- **Business Improvement** (increase productivity)
    	- **Market Development** (prioritising exporting)
    	- **Organisational Development** (leadership improvement)
    	- **Investment & Innovation** (high growth ventures)<br><br>
    - Projects are broken down: 
	    - CRM model is 1 application > 1 product > 1 appraisal
	    - Capture metrics at a service level rather than a project level (to satisfy needs of different parts of the business)
	    - Specialist create disconnected projects. The Account Manager(AM) does not always hear about them. 
	    - AM's have ways of getting things through but occasionally group against wrong products to simplify paperwork


??? note "Why breaking projects down can be bad"
    - It creates waste (admin etc...)
    - It makes it harder to stop all project work when needed
    - It hides lessons learned at too low a level to be shared well

??? note "Challenges"
    - Big Projects can be confusing to customers: who often think in more granular ways
    - Big project does not really fit with CRM
    - Non Service value add is hard to attribute (AM Advice etc...)
    - Leads to Big Project internal metrics driving what the customer sees (which again can be contrary to their world view)
    - How all this data flows through our systems is unclear

??? note "Customer Bahaviour"
    - DRM(Direct Resource Managed) use AM's well
    - NRM (Non Relationship Managed) use the website
    - We hide our Services/Products
    - Some customers view us as partners
    - Other Customers view us as individual Service/Grant Providers

??? note "Changes"
    - Move from Percentage limits to actual amounts. These are real. 
    - Customers think in £'s and not percentages
    - Customers still work harder when they have some skin(money) in the game.

## 2017: MyBusinessID
### Files
- [MyBusinessID:](files/2017-Mybusid.pdf)
### Summary


??? note "Background"
    **My Business ID** was initially intended to be a Scottish Government single sign on tool where basic data would be shared across HIE, SDS, SE, BG etc However at present, it’s only SE that uses MyBusinessID as an authorisation and registration tool to access the SE MY Account area and to sign up for newsletters, and BG for users registering for events.
    
     At SE we’re trying to determine whether we need to offer a tool that enables users to also access other public sector business-related websites using one log in and password and via a main account area. In tandem at SE, we also need to know what level of verification will be required for different services offered by SE and what verification tools we need to put in place.
    



??? note "Terminology"
    **Authorisation:**<br>
    Act of confirming that a registered user is entitled to access a service prior to permitting that access.
    <br><br>
    **Verification:**<br>
    Way to prove your identify when using government services by using tools such as Experian, Post Office, Royal Mail.
    <br><br>
    **Authentication:**<br>
    Act of ensuring or checking that a user of a service or system is the owner of the identity they claim to be.
    

??? note "Other Orgs looking at Business Logins"
     **Group 1 Scottish wide:**<br>
     - HIE<br>
     - BG<br>
     - SDS<br>
     
     **Group 2 Nationwide:**<br>
     - HMRC<br>
     - ONS<br>
     - Innovate UK<br>
     - Office of the Public Guardian<br>
     - Scottish Government, Government Gateway<br>

??? note "HMRC"
    - The driver for a verification process at HMRC is fraud reduction. No discovery took place to understand user needs as the business need was evident.<br>
    - They are designing a 2-step verification process (2SV) for business customers. The original focus was on small businesses (Ltd companies and sole traders) but they are now looking at larger businesses including agents<br>
    - 12 design sprints have taken place since May ’16. These included starting with telephone 2SV (in addition to Govt Gateway). They have tested personal or business verification and the use of commercial software apps (like Google Authenticator). In addition, they explored Verify and how it could link to an HMRC specific identity check for use in Tax Credits<br>

??? note "Challenges"
    - Companies may have multiple people involved in an interaction<br>
	    - One person may start the application<br>
	    - Another may have the information to complete it (this might even be an intermediary such as an Accountant)<br>
	    - Another may have the authority to sign and submit it<br>
	- Managing who has what permissions within(or on behalf of)  a company<br>
    - The verification that occurs Organically during Account Management (Face 2 Face) Interactions is harder to achieve digitally. <br>
    - Designing and Implementing 2 Stage Verification thats works for all customers<br>
    - 


??? notes "Routes in"
    - NRM (Business Gateway)<br>
        - Business Gateway id expected to have completed Verification already for NRM companies
    - DRM (Referral for Account Manager)<br>
    - Others: Chance meetings at events, conversations with specialists, segmentation referral, email or telephone etc...<br>
    - *No mention of online in this report*<br>

??? notes "Checks"
    - Fame Report<br>
    - Credit Check<br>
    - Companies House Check<br>
    - Full set of Company Accounts<br>
    - Disqualified Directors List<br>
    - Sanctions<br>
    - Address Flags<br>
    - Nexus Report<br>


??? note "Gaps"
    - EFRS – Digital Vouchers – know credit check and due diligence carried out but what does this involve?
    - Unclear what level (if any) of verification or due diligence is carried out by BG.
    - Unclear if any SLA in place to ensure verification/due diligence is carried out by BG.
    - No official SE policy on due diligence/verification – what is the unofficial line?
    - Does the customer know what checks are taking place?
    -  Has the customer given permission?
    - Are there different levels of verification depending on level of grant/support involved?
    - Where are these documented?
    - What, if any verification is taking place at the appraisal stage of an application.
    - Is verification mentioned in the grant contracts?
    - Contract management process – Companies house check – why does this take place, what is the purpose (is it to check address or something else.)

## 2016: Civic Report

### Files

- [Civic Report](files/2016-SE-UserTesting.pdf)

### Summary

Purpose: Conduct user research of the grant and finance pages on the SE and HIE websites


??? note "Searching & Applying for grants"
    - All test participants selected for testing had previous experience searching and applying for business grants from SE and other agencies. Some had successfully been awarded a SMART Scotland grant, others were given a grant to improve their website and one had just recently received a 'Make it to Market' grant.<br>
    - When asked how they searched for grant opportunities, some test participants used their SE account manager who advised them on funding opportunities available, others had either heard of a specific grant opportunity from peers, including business gateway or word of mouth from active communities they were involved in, such as CodeBase. Two test participants indicated that they would make an initial Google search <br>
    - Although all test participants were successful in applying for their business grants, there was still a great dealof uncertainty regarding the range of grants on offer from SE and from the public sector as a whole. There was a perception that finding a grant opportunity was only simple if businesses knew exactly the kind of grant they were looking for. Finding a suitable grant for their specific funding gap was much more problematic.


??? note "SE Grant Application Process"
    - There was a perception from all test participants that the grant application process is confusing, frustrating, lengthy, and sometimes time-wasting, particularly when the eligibility criteria is not explained clearly and businesses invest a lot of time preparing an application, only to be refused a funding opportunity at the end of the process. <br>

??? note "Experience and Expectations of SE Website"
    - Test participants who had previously visited the SE website when  looking for funding opportunities felt that the range of grant opportunities were not easy to find, and/or clearly presented or explained. This is partly because there is no single page where all funding opportunities are presented and because it is difficult to identify relevant funding opportunities.<br>
    - Funding criteria varies from business to business and identifying opportunities to fit specific needs and circumstances can be extremely difficult.<br>
    - Another common barrier is the language and terminology used to describe grant opportunities and the eligibility criteria required to secure funding.<br>


??? note "Encouraging Grant Applications"
    - During testing, we asked participants what SE could do in order to encourage more grant applications and a number of suggestions were offered, including the use of in-bound marketing via social media and SEO to raise
    - Another common suggestion from all participants was the need to make it more obvious what funding opportunities SE offer, including a single section of the website called 'Funding' which is clearly visible from the homepage and/or primary navigation. Clicking on this would provide an overview of all the funding/grants SE offer.<br>
    - All test participants suggested including a means of filtering funding options that are relevant to individual businesses. They suggested a tool/form which would allow businesses to complete a series of questions.<br>
    - Once complete, they would be presented with all relevant funding opportunities that they are eligible for.<br>
    - One test participant suggested developing a universal search tool which would provide a list of all grant/funding opportunities available to businesses, from both SE and from other agencies.<br>
    - Another test participant suggested uploading an example of a successful application form, with comments from reviewers. It was felt that this would help businesses understand the application process and what is required from the application form.<br>


??? note "Audience"
	- People are confused<br>


??? note "Site Interaction"
    - Participants all had experience of searching public sector for support
    - What is available to a business is confusing<br>
    - Peers, Word of Mouth, Search Engines, Other agencies and Account Managers were all used to find support <br>
	- Businesses feel that they have to know exactly what they need in order to find the right grant.<br>
	- Applying for Grants is confusing<br>
    - Applying for grants can seem like more bother than it is worth (Opportunity Cost)<br> 
    - **There is no clear route to information on Funding Opportunities for businesses**<br>
    - The APPLICATION sections seem light in Calls to Action and a clear direction. "**Make an Enquiry**" does not sound like "**Apply for this Grant**"

    
??? note "Structure"    
    - Have a nice simple FUNDING section<br>
    - Users welcome filtering of content to only show stuff that is relevant to them<br>
	- **The way that grants are structured on the SE website does not support the users natural journey in finding grant opportunities**<br>
	- Poor Search functionality & SEO hinders success when the Structure does not meet users mental model (expectations)
    - Certain info is in the wrong sections of pages (as seen by users). Example: *postcode checker not in the Eligibility section*<br>
    -  **There is no clear route to information on Funding Opportunities for businesses**<br>

??? note "Content & Language"
	- Language of Descriptions was confusing<br>
    - Terminology and Acrontms are used too much<br>
    - Eligibility Criteria are hard to understand<br> 
    - SE assumes a lot of knowledge from users that they might not have<br> 
    - Wording needs to be simpler<br> 
    - Headings need to be clerare and support the customers anticipated journey (Scent Trail for UX types)
    - Language is bland enough to not Differentiate between grants well. They all seem to be described as pretty similar things. 
    - Eligibility criteria can be confusing/ambiguous<br>
    - Quote: *similarly with the SE website, the HIE website uses language and messaging that is meaningless and unfamiliar to the user, making it difficult to find and understand the various grants on offer*<br>
    - **The language on the SE website is not clear and uses business jargon that is unfamiliar to the user**.

??? note "User Needs"
	- Make things easy, simple & obvious<br>
	- Put Funding and Grants on an easily found page. Link to it from everywhere relevant<br>
	- Site search needs to work


    
??? note "Suggestions"
    **IA**<br>
	- Ensure that all grant and funding opportunities are displayed on one page titled 'Funding' or 'Grants and Funding'<br>
	- Provide an obvious route to the 'Funding' page from the homepage and primary navigation structure so that regardless of where the user is within the site structure, they can easily find information on grant and funding opportunities<br>
	- Provide clear links to the 'Funding' page from various other pages within the site IA, including 'Industry Support', industry pages and the 'Services' page<br>
	- Work needs to be done to improve the site search. We are aware that this is a project which is currently underway, although we would be happy to advise on effective search engines/experiences<br>
	- Consider introducing a 'super navigation', providing a drop down function of the information available within each section of the primary navigation<br>
	**Marketing**<br>
	- SEO & keyword analysis<br>
	- Use Social media<br>
	- Be clearer about what we do<br>
	- Use SEO aware copywriters<br>
    **Content**<br>
	- Use Plain English to call things what they are<br>
	- Use this Plain English in Filter options
	- Be clear up front
	- Remove unnecessary information
	- Where eligibility is complicated; give examples of how it can be use
	**Applying**<br>
	- Consider adopting a consistent application process across all grant opportunities, as expected by users<br>
    - Consider offering an online application form so that users can complete their application online<br>
    - A simple way to do this would be to create an online account. If this was available, businesses could easily apply for future grants, having entered much of their business information previously to the system<br>
    - Allow users to save, edit and return to their application form at a later date and display a visible progress bar of their application submission<br>
    - As users start the application process, enable a facility to ask questions either via the application process and/or an online chat facility<br>
    - Allow users to submit sections of their application form for review<br>
    - Allow account managers/SE staff to flag changes, make notes and provide online guidance as part of the online application process, all through a secure area of the website<br>
    - Include a visual progress indicator to show users where their application is in the process, with a timescale indication of when the application is likely to be complete<br>

## 2015: NILE REPORT

### Files

- [Nile Report](files/2015-Nile.pdf)
April 2015 

### Summary

- The current homepage design does not convey what SE does, and the businesses it helps. 
- There is no clear user journey through the site for either the ‘confused’ or ‘convinced’ personas. 
- The content of the site did not meet participants’ expectations. They expected some guide content and were surprised not to find any. 
- The participants could not find an industry category that reflected their business accurately. 
- Participants missed the filter in the “Knowledge Hub” but this functionality was important as this section is large and diverse. 
- The clear user journey on the “Infinite Possibilities” site was really well received

??? Note "Navigation"
    - If people understand the top level nav titles then all is good. <br>
    If they don't then it is very bad <br>
    - Our language is often meaningless or confusing to our customers <br>
    - **Knowledge Hub** was not attractive to people<br>
    - More Filter options were required in the Knowledge Hub<br>
    - 

??? Note "Content"
    - People expect "Guide" style content that educates them on the topic. SE.COM merely sent them towards applications, events or contacts <br>
    - **Confused** Persona's expected more general explanatory content and did not like the streamlined **Service Summary > Eligibility > Apply** funnel <br>
    - **Convinced** Person's did appreciate the **Service Summary > Eligibility > Apply** funnel as they were already sold on the services. <br>
    - The Homepage is confusing for most people. It does not let companies know what we do and if they are the intended recipients<br>
    - **People often don't fit (or believe they fit) into our Industry Categories**<br>
    - Industry Pages were less engaging<br>
    - People liked the Trade Show support within Sevices or Case Studies<br>
    - MyBusinessID description was confused with other public sector login (Gov Gateway etc...)<br>
    - Companies were still not sure they were **Seeing Themselves** represented on the site<br>
    

??? Note "Case Studies"
    - They are great when they are quite specific and match the circumstances of the user.      <br>
    - This means that people want to see Case Studies of companies like them, that have the same issues as them.     <br>
    - Generic Case studies don't work as well.      <br>
    - This suggests that Case Studies are used Deeper in the site once users have self selected who they are and what they need.      <br>
    - They are better for **Confused** Personas and act as part of the decision making process.     <br>
    

??? Note "Campaign Pages/Sites"
    - Campaign content tends to work better as they are more focussed. They represent the ideal situation where all the content is focussed on just one journey. <br>
    - On normal websites the content is trying to do everything at once. <br>
    This shows the two extremes of **lost itpeok** vs **Curated Journey Content**<br>

??? Note "Search"
    - It's not hard...but we get it wrong anyway.     <br>
    - Search needs to be prominent and not hidden behind fancy UX/UI    <br>
    - Search needs to work    <br>
    - Search needs to work how people expect it to.     <br>
	- [Read the Search and Filter section for more detail across all our testing](filter.md)<br>

??? Note "Registration and Login"
    - This is a minefield<br>
    - Only ask people to Register when it is very clear what the benefit will be for them<br>
    - Don't hide stuff behind a Login just to justify making them register. People will find this annoying and it erodes trust.    <br>
    - Make your screens clearly delineate Registration vs Login.     <br>
    - Don't get clever. It almost never works.     <br>
    - Add Simplicity. You want people to be thinking as little as possible and just **concentrating on One Thing** when they register.     <br>
    - Example: "*I am giving you my details to creat an Account so that I can apply for this grant"*    <br>
    - Gradual engagement is great...as long as people understand that it is gradual engagement and not a trap.     <br>
    - People are happy enough to use 3rd party signin such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn as long as they are 100% certain what it is for and the limits of what info is used/shared/exposed    <br>
    - It was not clear that the **Sign In** link was also the **Register Link**<br>
    - Using LinkedIn to sign in was notionaly welcome **BUT** users worried that they were not being told enough about how their info would be used etc...<br> 


??? note "Design"
    - **Colours: People view Colours🎨 as having meaning. Use them wisely.**    <br>
    - Text Blocks: Large blocks of text are hard to read. Use Headings and Lists to create a scannable hierarchy of information    <br>
    - Images: Different people interpret images in different ways. Test images extensively. <br>
    - The Tiles don't coney information well<br>
    - People felt that the deeper pages in the site were too text heavy<br>
    - **Contacft Us** was good but could have been better (guidance, channel options ....) 

??? bug "Actions"
    - Improve the visibility of the existing filter<br>
    - Make the search visible in the header area<br>
    - Simplify the login page<br>
    - Involve your target users in the design process to flesh out User Journies<br>
    - "Industry" needs to be improved. It is useful but can create artificial Silos<br>

- Participants in the research all knew of Scottish Enterprise and were aware of its role. They consider SE to be a trustworthy source of information and would be more likely to trust information from SE’s website than other internet sources.<br>

- The information expected by participants to be included in the SE website includes a wide range of topics  under the following broad categories:<br>
    - SE Support & Advice<br>
    - SE Contacts<br>
    - SE Work & history<br>
    - Networking<br>
    - Sector Specific information<br>
    - Funding & Grants available<br>
    - Legislation<br>
    - Information links<br>

- Participants suggested a wide range of services and expectations but the common strand amongst these are that the website contains:<br>
    - What SE offers in terms of support and advice?<br>
    - Who to contact about this?<br>
    - Where to go for this?<br>
    - How this can be accessed?<br>

- Participants were asked their views on e-marketing: <br>
    - They stated advantages and disadvantaged to e-marketing and traditional hard copy materials and whilst both are seen to have their place. <br>
    - E-marketing is generally seen to be the most appealing. The key for those interviewed is that the direct marketing is not unsolicited. <br>
    - E-marketing should be personalised, targeted and relevant i.e. no mass e-marketing.<br>

	- <br>
	- <br>
	- <br>

??? note "How do Customers want to consume it"

	However it suits them<br>
	There is no singular answer to this. as business people now cover a wider spectrum of Digital abilities than ever before.<br>
	The only area that is reducing, is Physically in Person, but people still want to talk over other mediums. <br><br>
	- F2F - P2P(Person to Person)  <br>
	- Digital - P2P<br>
	- Digital - Remote (Non real time)<br>
	- Letter<br>
	- Phone<br>

??? note "What is possible in this area"

	- F2F - P2P(Person to Person)

	- Digital - P2P<br>
		- Covert Personalisation (Done automatically or by us)<br>

	- Letter<br>

	- Marketing Tools<br>
	- Analytics Tools<br>
	- Managing Tasks<br>
	- App Dev<br>
	- Content<br>
	
??? note "What is likely"

	- In the short term, we have a lot of work to get disparate systems to talk to each other. <br>
	- After another systems LifeCycle, (circa 5 years), we should be looking at consolidating systems to make joined up user journeys easier <br>
	- <br>
	- <br>
	- <br>
	- <br>

??? note "How does Language work for users"

	- They hate jargon and complicated speach<br>
	- Plain English works best<br>
	- Less is more<br>
	- Some Industries do expect to hear their own Terminology used<br>
	- Avoid **"our"** terminology<br>
	- Acknowledge **"their"** terminology<br>
	- The way we Name things really does not work well. We need to use customer language
	- Things need to **Say What They Do**

??? note "Consider potential site structures and navigation"

	- People hate being bounced around sites<br>
	- People want each site to ONLY contain the stuff they are interested in<br>
	- This suggests a federated model such as BBC etc... where microsites are very focused but, fit within an umbrella structure<br>
	- *Stop calling this "Hub and Spoke"* :-o<br>

??? note "Questions & Observations"

	- Question: "Our people are our strength". How do we leverage that on our websites<br>
	- Question: "Our people are our strength". How far down the list are we n(of support providers) <br>
	- Question: Why don't we have a universal Login/Account for businesses<br>
	- Question: How can all **CHECKS** be automated (Credit, Fame, Companies House, Sanctions etc...)<br>
	- Question: How do we increase efficiency with DIGITAL without losing the personal connection<br>
	- Question: Why are our models so complicated<br>
	<br>
	- Observation: How we package(group) things does not always make sense to businesses<br>
	- Observation: Businesses do not always think at the scale we do. They are often quite granular whilst we think of entire Cradle to Grave journeys<br>
	- Observation: Attribution and Metrics make us do Sub-Optimal things<br>
	- Observation: Customer Data does not flow and collate well within our systems<br>
	- Observation: We need a model for how a Universal Account should work (High Level Model)<br>
	- Observation: <br>
	- Observation: <br>
