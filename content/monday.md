# Monday.com Project Management System

The key learnings from this Project after initial implementation 

## Intro
- People like the system overall
  BUT
- It has only been configured to work on the MPM (Major Project Management) model and using the standard PLC (Project Life Cycle)
- Few teams use the PLC in a standard way 

## Pros
- It could be transformative for the organisation (with a few tweaks)

## Cons
- It still needs tweaks to realise it's potential for most people. 
- It does not store the data that we need
-
