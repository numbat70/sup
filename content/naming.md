# Naming Things

- We name things according to "OUR" logic and terminology. 
  Customers hate this
  - Acronyms only work for people who know them already (and even then they trip them up)
- Customers want names "**that make sense to them**"
- Customers like names "That say what they do" but in Customer Language/Terminology
- People prefer **Verbs over Nouns**
- **Verbs** are viewed as **Active** and **Doing**
- When naming things we need to remember that companies must think in terms of "What's in this for me"
- **Names are the start of a Scent Trail**  Ensure that you are thinking about this when naming things

## Scottish Enterprise
We have previously asked customers about alternative names for the SE Website
Thes have included: 

- Scottish Enterprise
- Enterprise Scotland
- Enterprising Scotland
- Economy Scotland
- Economic Development Scotland



### Results 
- **Keeping the current name was heavily supported** 
- There is a large amount of Brand Awareness around the name Scottish Enterprise<br>**BUT**
- People are not very sure what we do. 
- People prefer "DOING" words such as "Enterprising"
- "**Scotland**" was also viewed as positive <br> This follows common patterns of people preferring Verbs over Nouns, and also Plain English phrases that "**say what they do**"

## Sub Brands

We investigated awareness and feedback on: 

- Talent Scotland 
- Invest Scotland 
- Export Scotland 
- Innovation Scotland

### Results

- There was a very mixed response to this group
- The names were confusing to some with a variety of understandings. 
- “**Export Scotland**” was clearly understood and received well
- “Innovation Scotland” came second but was misunderstood by some
- “Invest Scotland” was third but some people viewed it as “Scotland Investing in Scotland.” 
- “Talent Scotland” was last as it confused people and there were some unkind comments about singing competitions. 


## SDI (Scottish Development International)
- Within Scotland there is a lower awareness of the SDI brand. <br> This is to be expected.
- International* respondents often thought it was about "Exporting"
- "Development" is often misunderstood and not associated with "Trade" or "Investment"
* Panel from Netherlands, France, Germany, UK and USA


## Scotland vs Scottish
People make a distinction between “Scottish” & “Scotland”

- “**Scottish**” was to do with “**Being Scottish**” and what that meant“
- "**Scotland**” was about the country and being “ **for the good of the country**”


## Find Business Support
We tested a lot of different names and the overwhelming response was: 

- Pick a name that "**Says what it does**"
- **Find Business Support** was by far the most popular name suggested.
