### Summary

??? note "Background"
    **My Business ID** was initially intended to be a Scottish Government single sign on tool where basic data would be shared across HIE, SDS, SE, BG etc However at present, it’s only SE that uses MyBusinessID as an authorisation and registration tool to access the SE MY Account area and to sign up for newsletters, and BG for users registering for events.
    
     At SE we’re trying to determine whether we need to offer a tool that enables users to also access other public sector business-related websites using one log in and password and via a main account area. In tandem at SE, we also need to know what level of verification will be required for different services offered by SE and what verification tools we need to put in place.

??? note "HMRC"
    - The driver for a verification process at HMRC is fraud reduction. No discovery took place to understand user needs as the business need was evident.<br>
    - They are designing a 2-step verification process (2SV) for business customers. The original focus was on small businesses (Ltd companies and sole traders) but they are now looking at larger businesses including agents<br>
    - 12 design sprints have taken place since May ’16. These included starting with telephone 2SV (in addition to Govt Gateway). They have tested personal or business verification and the use of commercial software apps (like Google Authenticator). In addition, they explored Verify and how it could link to an HMRC specific identity check for use in Tax Credits<br>

??? note "Challenges"
    - Companies may have multiple people involved in an interaction<br>
	    - One person may start the application<br>
	    - Another may have the information to complete it (this might even be an intermediary such as an Accountant)<br>
	    - Another may have the authority to sign and submit it<br>
	- Managing who has what permissions within(or on behalf of)  a company<br>
    - The verification that occurs Organically during Account Management (Face 2 Face) Interactions is harder to achieve digitally. <br>
    - Designing and Implementing 2 Stage Verification thats works for all customers<br>

    - EFRS – Digital Vouchers – know credit check and due diligence carried out but what does this involve?
    - Unclear what level (if any) of verification or due diligence is carried out by BG.
    - Unclear if any SLA in place to ensure verification/due diligence is carried out by BG.
    - No official SE policy on due diligence/verification – what is the unofficial line?
    - Does the customer know what checks are taking place?
    -  Has the customer given permission?
    - Are there different levels of verification depending on level of grant/support involved?
    - Where are these documented?
    - What, if any verification is taking place at the appraisal stage of an application.
    - Is verification mentioned in the grant contracts?
    - Contract management process – Companies house check – why does this take place, what is the purpose (is it to check address or something else.)
